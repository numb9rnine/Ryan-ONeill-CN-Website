        Rinus Michels tactical developments at Ajax introduced “Total Football” to the football world in a system that used versatile players in interchangeable attacking roles moving fluidly across the pitch to “shock and awe” opponents. <br>
        While fluidity and dynamism became popular aspects of TotalFootball, it was the concept of space that effected a fundamental shift in football thinking. It was the central concept around which everything revolved.<br>
        <br>
        Michels’ and his players at Ajax, interpreted football in terms of creating and organizing space. Cruyff distilled the essence of using space as a founding visualization — If you have the ball you must make the field as big as possible, and if you don’t have the ball you must make it as small as possible.<br>
        <br>
        At that time, this was seminal thought. Today it’s considered as a fundamental of football strategy. The modern game is predicated on the paradigm of space. The concepts of “attacking shape”, “defending shape”, “playing off the ball” etc. all of which relate to spatial awareness, are now part of core football vocabulary. They’ve become commonplace in commentary even!<br>
        <br>
        Honed by Michels and executed on-field by poster boy Cruyff, TotalFootball became a synonym of beautiful football. The compendium of revolutionary concepts and tactics that Michels had perfected at Ajax (and Barcelona), was exhibited at the world stage in 1974, to unprecedented acclaim.<br>
        <br>

        Though Cruyff's mentor, Rinus Michels, (voted FIFA's Coach of the Century in 1999, he guided Ajax to four Eredivisie titles in the 1960s and the Netherlands to the 1988 European Championship) was the brains behind the game-changing style of "Total Football," Cruyff personified it.<br>
        <br>

        Johan Cruyff is without question one of the most influential figures in the history of football. His pedigree as a player, which includes three consecutive European Cup wins with the great Ajax team of the 1970s and a World Cup final with the Netherlands in 1974, is enough to guarantee this. <br>
        <br>
        But his work as a coach, characterised by an unwavering commitment to an attacking and attractive style of play, enhances his legacy even more.Cruyff led only two teams during a little over 10 years in management: his beloved Ajax (1985-1988) and, between 1988 and 1996, Barcelona – the club at which he built a squad of serial winners that would win four consecutive Spanish league titles between 1991 and 1994, secure the 1992 European Cup and become known as the Dream Team.<br>
        <br>
        Louis Van Gaal’s philosophy was based on a turbo-charged version of the Total Football style. The system required players to be able to occupy any role on the pitch, so the players maintained their structure at all times. Out of possession, they would be instructed to hound opponents collectively, to retrieve the ball as quickly as possible.
        It was a style that demanded technical quality, tactical intelligence and supreme athleticism. <br>
        <br>
        Only the most talented and selfless players could thrive in Van Gaal’s system, and he set about forming his football factory to put together a production line of players who would be a perfect fit.Over the last 2 decades, Louis Van Gaal has won league titles and a European Cup with Ajax, La Liga titles with Barcelona, a german title with Bayern Munich and an English FA Cup with Manchester United.

            From 1988 through 1994, Milan was unstoppable. They not only won a lot of trophies, but they did so in a gallant style that fundamentally changed the game, especially in their own country. Arrigo Sacchi revolutionised football by introducing the pressing game, and as a result, he oversaw Italian football's most successful era in Europe. When he moved on to the national team, his successor Fabio Capello carried on the tradition. The club included one of the most impressive defences ever built, a hardworking midfield, and front-line flair players.<br>
            <br>

            In the 1987–88 season, Milan won its first Scudetto in nine years under Sacchi's leadership. Milan's semi-final victory over Real Madrid CF in the 1988/89 European Cup was a historic moment for the club.  At home, Madrid was thought to be invincible, and Milan was anticipated to sit back and take it in the first leg at the Santiago Bernabéu. Sacchi, on the other hand, had other ideas. His team grabbed control and were unfortunate to be held to a 1-1 draw. It doesn't matter. They triumphed 5-0 in the return leg in Milan, with Ancelotti scoring the game's first goal. The club defeated Romanian club Steaua București 4–0 in the final to win its first European Cup in two decades.<br>
            <br>
             
            With a sleek 4-4-2 system that included zonal marking (then unheard of in Italy), a high defensive line, and springing the offside trap, they made rival teams exceedingly uncomfortable. Sacchi’s workouts were well-known for their rigour and intensity. He was recognised for doing a lot of work without a ball to improve player positioning, and it paid off. Milan won the European Cup again a year later, defeating Benfica 1–0, and was the only team to win back-to-back European Cups until Real Madrid did so in 2017. In the Italian press, the Milan team of 1989–90 was dubbed the "Immortals."<br>
            <br>
             
            But after a trophy-less season in 1991/92, Sacchi departed, replaced by Fabio Capello. It was just the shot in the arm Milan needed to get back on track. As their love affair with the Champions League continued, they won another league title, as well as numerous domestic honours and a narrow defeat in the final against Marseille. They came together for one more dance in 1993/94, summoning all of their class and experience and adopting a more defensive strategy to beat Juventus by three points.<br>
            <br>
            
            Milan took control early on and were rewarded when Dejan Savicevic dashed down the right-wing and passed to Daniele Massaro, who tapped the ball into an empty net. After a solo run down the left flank by Roberto Donadoni, Massaro scored his second shortly before halftime to make it 2–0. Savicevic scored the third goal in the 47th minute, capitalising on a defensive blunder by Miguel Angel Nadal to lob goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta. After Savicevic had struck a post and the Barcelona defence had failed to clear, Milan midfielder Marcel Desailly overcame the offside trap eight minutes later to make it 4–0, which was the final score"><br>
            <br>
             
            They turned up the heat one last time in Athens, destroying Barça with a stunning display of aggressive football and lifting the trophy that had been synonymous with them throughout that golden era. The revolution of the Rossoneri was accomplished. In the 1994 Final, they stunned doubters by defeating a superb Barcelona squad 4-0. Maldini would go on to play for Milan for another 15 years, becoming a legend in the process. Italian football hasn’t been the same since.<br>

            Pep Guardiola has become synonymous with the idea over the last decade, but what is the story behind the tactical phenomenon?
            Perhaps the single greatest tactical revolution that helped Spain to dominate world football in the early part of this decade was tiki-taka.<br>
            <br>
            
            The short, sharp passing style was forged, along with many of the greatest players of the age, in Barcelona’s La Masia academy and it was the Camp Nou club that trademarked the brand, with Pep Guardiola often considered its father.
            "He is the Steve Jobs of football: experimental, brave, a lover of beauty and innovative," Real Madrid legend Jorge Valdano said when the Catalan stood down from his role as Barca head coach in 2012. "He is a reference point in world football and rightly so. Barca have turned their football into a culture."<br>
            <br>
            At the heart of the tactic is possession of the football. The idea is for a team to monopolise possession, using their technical superiority and fluidity of positioning to overcome opponents.<br>
            <br>
            Although there is no definitive answer as to where the name came from, one theory is that Spanish commentator Andres Montes coined it during Spain’s 2006 World Cup run who said: “We’re playing with the ball tiki-taka, tiki-taka.”
            As the sound of the name may suggest, one-touch passing is an essential skill to successfully pull off this strategy, although there is more to it than simple retention of the ball.<br>
            <br>
            
            Having won every trophy under the sun at FC Porto, Mourinho took to the Premier League like a duck to water, wrestling the title away from Arsenal's 'Invincibles' with a record-breaking defensive record.
            
            And by the time he returned to the dugout with Inter Milan in 2008 after parting ways with Chelsea, Mourinho was still rightfully revered as one of the finest coaches in the beautiful game.<br>
            <br>
            
            In fact, while Mourinho might have only spent 18 months in the San Siro dugout, it was arguably the most successful stint of his entire career, securing a historic treble in his only full season in charge.
            Now, on paper, winning Serie A and the Coppa Italia might not sound all that impressive in Inter's era of dominance, but it was the Champions League triumph that particularly stood out for Mourinho.<br>
            <br>
            In truth, by the time Inter locked horns with Bayern Munich in the final, 'Big Ears' was already in the bag with Diego Milito scoring twice in a Bernabeu climax that Mourinho never looked like losing.
            And it was the semi-final war with Pep Guardiola's Barcelona, who were objectively the world's best team at the time, that secured European glory with Inter battling their way to a 3-2 aggregate win.
            The 1-0 second leg 'defeat' at Camp Nou lives long in the memory, sure, but it was Mourinho's 3-1 masterclass in the opening tie in Milan that will go down as one of his greatest ever results.<br>
            <br>
            While both managers won everything there was to win in Spain at Barcelona and Real Madrid, they were direct rivals for titles in Europe while Pep was at Bayern Munich and Jose at Inter Milan. They also locked horns in England where Pep’s Manchester City dominated domestic titles and Jose won the league cup and Europa League trophy with Manchester United.

            <p>Gegenpressing and RocknRoll Football: Ralf Rangnick, Jurgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel</p>

            Ralf Rangnick is known as ‘the godfather of gegenpressing’.<br>
            <br>
            Asked to describe this, Rangnick explained: “Well, it’s very simple,” Rangnick says. “[Gegenpressing is] a very proactive style of football.<br>
            <br>
            “We like to press high, with a very intense counter-pressure. When we have the ball, we do not like any square or back passes.
            “The goalkeeper also should not be the one with the most contact on the ball. In almost every league and every country, the goalkeeper is technically the most limited football player on the pitch and therefore we have to make sure that he has the lowest contact with the feet.<br>
            <br>
            “It is a fast, proactive, attacking, counter-attacking, counter-pressing, exciting and entertaining [style of] football.”
            When it comes to formations, Rangnick is adaptable, playing a 4-3-3 at Hoffenheim which was later adapted to a 4-4-2 diamond<br>
            <br>
            Utilising this style, Rangnick revolutionised german football and took the RB franchise from the third tiers of football into Champions League semi finalists and regular title contenders in the top flight. His most famous and successful disciples of this style have been Jurgen Klopp who broke the Bayern monopoly in Germany, winning 2 titles and taking Borussia Dortmund to the Champions League final.<br>
            <br> 
            Klopp describes this style as “Rock N Roll football” and his teams are relentless pressers. Thomas Tuchel was Klopp’s successor at Dortmund and carried on the tradition but with a more reserved defensive style, adding an element of Italian defensive structures into the mix. <br>
            <br>
            Between the three of them, german football placed itself firmly in the mix of the European elite, but all three of them would later join both Guardiola and Mourinho in the elite league in Europe, the English Premier League.

            At the time of writing Pep Guardiola has 27 senior-level trophies, Jose Mourinho (25) and Carlo Ancelotti (20). Alex Ferguson though cleans out the arena with a whopping 49 trophies! <br>
            <br>
            He’s won more trophies than any manager — and indeed even more than many more famous names put together even. From breaking the Old Firm’s duopoly with Aberdeen’s title-winning run, and beating Real Madrid in a European final,  to claiming every domestic and continental honour with Manchester United at least once, Ferguson remains unparalleled in terms of elite-level silverware.<br>
            <br>

            Alex Ferguson combined discipline, control and tactical flexibility to win numerous titles with Manchester United.<br>
            <br>
            
            It is this flexibility that Ferguson dominated the English Premier league for 2 decades with that indeed makes the league so elite. Unlike other leagues, it is not wedded to one cultural or tactical style. <br>
            <br>
            
            The Premier League is now home to the tiki taka style of Pep’s Manchester City, with shades of Sacchi. Jurgen Klopp finally won his coveted European cup as manager of Liverpool and ended their thirty year wait for a Premier League trophy. Thomas Tuchel won the Champions League with Chelsea and Ralf Rangnick is now the manager of Manchester United. <br>
            <br>

            European football history has culminated into it's finest talents locking horns in one league, the elite of the elite.
